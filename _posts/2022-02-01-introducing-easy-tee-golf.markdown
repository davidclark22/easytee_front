At Easy Tee Golf we’re excited to announce that we’re out of beta! After a successful pilot launch in 2021 with a small number of golf courses, we’re now offering our easy to use tee sheet management software to golf courses everywhere. 

Our pilot golf courses saw great success with online booking and prepayment, with over 70% of tee times booked online by customers! That represents many hours and hundreds of phone calls that they didn’t have to take, saving time for both the golf course staff and for their customers. Also, by taking pre-payment, our courses have reduced no-shows and are able to maintain social distancing. 

If you’re looking for an easy way to manage tee sheets, don’t hesitate to reach out at [info@easyteegolf.com](mailto:info@easyteegolf.com){:target="_blank"}. We’ll be happy to answer your questions, set you up for a 30 day free trial, or schedule a quick demo to show you all of what Easy Tee Golf can do for you!
