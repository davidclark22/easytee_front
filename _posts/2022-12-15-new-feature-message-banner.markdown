We’re making it easier for you to communicate with your customers. Starting today, we’re launching a messaging banner at the top of your booking pages. This banner will allow you to let customers know about temporary conditions at your golf course that may impact their round. 

From aerated greens to frost or other weather delays, our new messaging banner will tell your customers exactly what to expect when they arrive at your course.

This banner is available starting today to all golf courses using Easy Tee Golf. It’s easy to set up and easy to manage, right from your settings menu. 

If you’re not using Easy Tee yet at your golf course, send us a note at [info@easyteegolf.com](mailto:info@easyteegolf.com){:target="_blank"} to find out how you can try Easy Tee Golf free for 30 days.
