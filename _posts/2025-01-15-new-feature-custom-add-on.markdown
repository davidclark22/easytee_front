We are thrilled to announce a new and exciting feature for Easy Tee Golf that will give golf courses and simulators even more opportunities to optimize their bookings and cater to their customers' needs. Introducing our custom add-on feature!

With this new feature, golf courses and simulators can now create and offer any type of add-on that customers can seamlessly add to their bookings. This opens up a world of possibilities for both businesses and golfers, allowing for a more personalized and convenient booking experience.

<h5 class="my-4">Benefits for Golf Courses and Simulators</h5>

* **Increased Revenue:** The custom add-on provides an excellent opportunity to generate additional revenue by offering services or products that complement your core business (like range balls, rental clubs, and more!).
* **Enhanced Customer Experience:** By allowing customers to add items to their booking, they enjoy a more complete and streamlined experience at your facility.
* **Improved Efficiency:** Easy Tee Golf's easy-to-use add-on management system makes it easy to create, manage, and optimize your add-on.

<h5 class="my-4">Getting Started with a Custom Add-On</h5>

The process of creating and managing your custom add-on is simple and intuitive. With Easy Tee Golf's user-friendly interface, you can easily:

1. Define the add-on service or product - give it a name and set the maximum quantity customers can add to a booking
2. Set a price for the add-on - you can even charge different prices for members vs non-members
3. Optionally, link the add-on to an item from your Square POS item catalog (this allows us to itemize transactions in your Square account)
4. Activate your add-on

Once you've activated your add-on, it will be automatically offered to customers during the booking process. Customers can easily select and add the add-on if they want to add it to their booking.

We believe that the custom add-on feature offers you an opportunity to generate additional revenue and streamlines the experience for your customers.
