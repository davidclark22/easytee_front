    If you're on this page, you're probably already familiar with GolfNow. You might even be one of their customers. If you're not familiar with them, GolfNow provides a tee time booking engine and marketplace. The company utilizes a bartering system where golf courses provide them with tee times in exchange for access to their technology and other services, instead of paying out of pocket. GolfNow sells the tee times, often at a big discount and keeps the proceeds. But for golf courses, is trading tee times actually a good deal? <!-- excerpt -->Sure, it might sound good to not pay anything out of pocket, but what's the real cost of bartering tee times?
