Golf courses that use Easy Tee can offer their customers the ease of booking tee times 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on our easy-to-use platform. Since Easy Tee integrates with Square, all of the course’s online and in person payments go through the same system making tracking and reporting a breeze. 

We’ve made getting started with Easy Tee effortless with our white glove onboarding, and all new customers get a 30 day, no obligation free trial. If you’re ready to get started, just send us a note at [info@easyteegolf.com](mailto:info@easyteegolf.com){:target="_blank"}. After collecting some basic information, we set up your profile, schedule, and pricing and that’s it! You can start booking tee times immediately. Most new customers are set up in less than 24 hours.
